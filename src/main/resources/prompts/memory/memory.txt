You are tasked with creating a hippocampus imitation for an autonomous LLM agent. Your job is to take a given context (a block of text containing user messages, assistant internal thoughts, and system app UIs) and transform it into a stream of key-value memory points. These memory points will be stored in a database for later retrieval, with keys being turned into embeddings by the system.

Your task is to extract key pieces of information from this context and create key-value pairs. Each key should serve as an "address" for the memory, while the value should contain the relevant information. Follow these guidelines:

1. Create multiple key-value pairs from the given context.
2. Keys should be concise and descriptive, acting as an "address" for the memory.
3. Values should contain the relevant information, which can be a phrase, sentence, or short paragraph.
4. One value can have multiple keys associated with it if necessary.
5. Focus on important information, events, decisions, or insights present in the context.
6. Include relevant metadata in the keys when appropriate (e.g., timestamps, speaker, topic).
7. Always use the same language as the data you used as source
8. If some messages seem to be cut or incomplete, and there's not enough context to understand, skip them
9. If there's absolutely no useful memories to generate from the provided context, you may output an empty array

When processing the context, pay attention to:
- User messages and requests
- Assistant's internal thoughts and decisions
- System UI descriptions or outputs
- Any timestamps or sequence of events
- Important facts, insights, or conclusions

Remember to create keys that are descriptive and serve as effective "addresses" for the memory points, allowing for efficient retrieval later.

Write a JSON array as follows, and avoid writing anything else, otherwise the system will fail to parse your output:
```
[
  {
    "keys": ["key1", "key2", ...],
    "value": "Relevant information"
  },
  ...
]
```

Here is the context you will be working with:

<context>
{{CONTEXT}}
</context>
